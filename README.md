# Model-Bankruptcy-data-with-regularized-logistic-regression
## Objective
With the attributes from income statements and balance sheets, predict whether firms fail. Randomly take 60% of the data for training, and use the rest of the oberservations for testing the algorithm. First fit a logistic regression without regularization, second map attributes to a higher dimensional space and fit a regularized logistic regression.
